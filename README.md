This repo contains the official PyTorch implementation on the simplification of the [ONG](https://aclanthology.org/2020.emnlp-main.719/) (and [BiLSTM+BERT+GCN](https://aclanthology.org/2021.emnlp-main.722.pdf)) model for paper [Trading Syntax Trees for Wordpieces:
Target-oriented Opinion Words Extraction with Wordpieces and Aspect
Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11034) accepted in the proceedings at [ACL 2023](https://2023.aclweb.org/).

Details on the TOWE Datasets can be found in [(Fan et al., 2019)](https://aclanthology.org/N19-1259.pdf).

Train and evaluate "ONG(S,A) w/o GCN" on the datasets using: 
```
python run.py
```
