## Simplifying Syntax-Aware models for Target-oriented Opinion Words Extraction

This repo contains the official PyTorch implementation on the simplification of the ONG (and BiLSTM+BERT+GCN) model for paper [Trading Syntax Trees for Wordpieces:
Target-oriented Opinion Words Extraction with Wordpieces and Aspect
Enhancement](https://aclanthology.org/2021.emnlp-main.722.pdf) accepted in the proceedings at [ACL 2023](https://2023.aclweb.org/).
